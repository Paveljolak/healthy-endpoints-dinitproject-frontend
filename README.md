# Healthy Endpoints Dinit Project

### Project Description:

This repository contains the frontend part of a Spring Boot application developed for the summer camp at DInit d.o.o.

The application is designed to monitor the health of URLs. The application follows a three-tier architecture, using REST APIs and DTOs to efficiently manage data across a presentation, business logic, and data access layers.

### Key features:

- Background Health Check Service: Continuosly monitors all of the URLs at a regular intervals using a scheduled timer.
- Health Check: Check the health of the URL. If its healthy it will return true, if its not healthy it will return false. This is done in one of two ways:
  - Reachability check: A URL is considered healthy if it returns an HTTTP status code between 200 and 300.
  - Status Check: If the URL returns status code between 200 and 300, the service inspects the JSON response's status property and classifies the URL as: "Healthy" when the status property indicates a healthy state, and "Unhealthy" when the status propert indicates an unhealthy state.
